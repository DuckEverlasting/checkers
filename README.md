# Checkers: The Game
At the moment, this is a console-based game of checkers, which can be played by two people or by one person against an AI opponent.

Focus has been on developing the AI behavior. Future plans include building out a user interface (possibly in Spring) and improving the presentation of the game in general.

## How to play:
- Answer prompts in the console to play the game.
- Initialize a game by answering first how many human players there are (1 or 2) and by setting a difficulty level (currently 1, 2, or 3)
- To move a piece, type first the piece's ID and then the direction you want the piece to move. Directions are Up Right, Up Left, Down Right, and Down Left. (UR, UL, DR, and DL are accepted as shorthand.)
- For example, "12 ur" means "move piece number 12 up right, or jump over the enemy piece if there is one there".

Have Fun!
